# Neo-bank Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn for a neo-bank using machine learning techniques.
## Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is crucial for banks to retain their customers. This project uses various data analysis and machine learning methods to identify and predict which customers are likely to leave the bank. The end results are probability customers on another dataset to churn and the prediction of the machine learning model in `final result.csv`
## Repository Structure
- `Neo bank churn prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook file containing data analysis, preprocessing, and modelling code.
## Getting Started
### Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tunglam-2005/Neo-bank-churn-prediction.git
    cd Neo-bank-churn-prediction
    ```
## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Getting data from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis, using Kmeans Cluster to split it into 2 classes: churn and not churn.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to find patterns and insights.
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict customer churn.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model for production use.
